"""
Develop a banking system where there is an “Account” class. This class will have an
attribute “balance” denoting the balance of the account. You can deposit some amount of
money in the account through a method called deposit(amount). You can also withdraw
an amount of money through a method called withdraw(amount). But if the user tries to
withdraw an amount more than their current balance, raise a custom error called
“NotEnoughBalance”. Inside the withdraw() function, raise this error when appropriate,
and also deal with this error using try and except blocks.
